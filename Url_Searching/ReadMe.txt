Url Searching:
Since I had an ambiguity if you are looking for just tweeted tweets or tweets from the time you run the program, I wrote two source codes for either cases.
Executable files and Python source codes are included.

This code create an app that will be executed in terminal or from the command line. The app accepts a hashtag as an argument and only prints out unique urls found in the 100 most recent tweets that matched the hashtag.
