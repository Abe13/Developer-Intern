Developer Intern Exercise

Url Searching:
Since I had an ambiguity if you are looking for just tweeted tweets or tweets from the time you run the program, I wrote two source codes for either cases.

-Create an app that will be executed in terminal or from the command line. The app should accept a hashtag as an argument and should only print out unique urls found in the 100 most recent tweets that matched the hashtag.
